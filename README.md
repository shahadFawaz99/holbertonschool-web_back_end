# Holberton School - Web Back End Projects

This repository contains several Python projects focused on asynchronous programming, variable annotations, and async comprehensions as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Directory Structure

- **python_variable_annotations/**  
  Projects covering Python 3 type annotations for functions and variables.  
  Tasks include defining annotated functions, working with complex types, and type hinting.

- **python_async_function/**  
  Projects on writing asynchronous Python functions using `asyncio`.  
  Includes tasks on coroutines, running concurrent tasks, measuring execution time, and working with asyncio tasks.

- **python_async_comprehension/**  
  Projects on asynchronous generators, async comprehensions, and running multiple async tasks concurrently.  
  Covers creating async generators, collecting data via async comprehensions, and measuring runtime of parallel async coroutines.

## How to Use

Each project directory contains Python files implementing the tasks.  
You can run and test your solutions using Python 3.7+ to support async features and type annotations.
